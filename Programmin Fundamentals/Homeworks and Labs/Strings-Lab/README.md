## 01.Reverse string
Write a program that reads a string from the console, reverses it and prints the result back at the console.

## 02.Count substring occurrences
Write a program to **find how many times a given string appears in a given text as substring**. The text is given at the first input line. The search string is given at the second input line. The output is an integer number. Please ignore the **character casing. Overlapping** between occurrences is **allowed**. 

## 03.Text filter
Write a program that takes a **text** and a **string of banned words**. All words included in the ban list should be replaced with **asterisks "*"**, equal to the word's length. The entries in the ban list will be separated by a **comma** and **space** ", ".
The ban list should be entered on the first input line and the text on the second input line.

## 04.Palindromes
Write a program that extracts from a given text all palindromes, e.g. ABBA, lamal, exe and prints them on the console on a single line, separated by comma and space. Use spaces, commas, dots, question marks and exclamation marks as word delimiters. Print only **unique** palindromes, **sorted** lexicographically.
